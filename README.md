## Quickstart

### Run the app
1. Download a nightly for your OS (or build from source).
2. Unzip and run the binary. On macOS, you may need to right-click â†’ Open the first time.
3. From the app, load a sample or create a new split file.

### Create your first splits (basic flow)
- Create a new split file (Game + Category).
- Add segments, then start a run.
- Press your **Split** hotkey (default: `Space`) at each segment end.

> Hotkeys are configurable in the app settings (Windows supported first). Global hotkeys on macOS/Linux are planned.

## Features (current & roadmap)
- **Timer**: HH:MM:SS.cc display with centiseconds; formatting adapts to hours/minutes.
- **Split editor**: add/rename/reorder segments; total attempts; planned import/export.
- **Hotkeys**: split, reset, pause; Windows global hooks implemented; cross-platform planned.
- **Data**: simple JSON split files (`.osf`) for portability; future migration tooling planned.
- **Skins**: theme tokens + component styles + images; per-skin folder with live switching.
- **Integrations**: Speedrun.com lookup for game/category art (upcoming).

## Architecture

OpenSplit uses **[Wails](https://wails.io/)** to bundle a Go backend and a React/TypeScript frontend.
